Pomodoro Clock Project for FreeCodeCamp

## User stories:
1. I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
2. I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
3. I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

**Note:** To efficiently illustrate functionality, this pomodoro clock operates in seconds—not minutes.
